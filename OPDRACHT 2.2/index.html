    <h1>HTML Fundamentals</h1>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
<p>Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web <br>
    It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of <br>
    the web. Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.</p>

    <br>

<h2>What are HTML-Elements?</h2>
<p>Elements are what we use to tell the browser how we want the data supplied to be <br>
    displayed.</p> 
    <br>
    <h2>What is a tag?</h1>
    <p>An element consists of an opening and closing tag. The data supplied between the tags will <br>
        be displayed per the instructions of the element.</p>

        <br>

<h2>How does the browser use HTML to create what I see?</h2>
<p>The browser reads and interprets the HTML file to understand how the developer intended <br>
    the data to appear on the screen.</p>
    
    <br>

    <h2>What are the basic HTML-Elements?</h2>
    <p>The elements we learned about were html, head, body, ‘p’, span, div, and h1-h6</p>
    
    <br>

    <h1>More Elements</h1>
    <h2>A-tag</h2>
    <p>The ‘a’ (“anchor”) element, allows us to create links to other web pages (or even to other <br>
        areas within our own web page). You will always see the ‘a’ element used with <br>
        the href attribute to tell the browser what address you want the link to point to.</p>

        <br>

        <h2>Img-tag</h2>
        <p>This element will display an image on the screen. It will always have an ‘src’ attribute which <br>
            points to the address of the image to be displayed. NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in <br>
            they do not need two tags. Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag:</p>
            <img src="2.png" alt="picture2">
